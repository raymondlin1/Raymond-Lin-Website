							Happy 2019 everyone! 2018 was an eventful year full of ups and downs. I got my first girlfriend in July, and we have been together happily for almost 6 months now! I have gained many new skills for my career, including large-scale programming projects, new languages (C, Python, HTML/CSS), and other tools (Unity, Git). I have also learned a lot about academic rigor at UCLA by earning my first C in a class - a new years resolution of mine is to work harder in school and dedicate more time to studying. I have recently taken up a hobby of attending music festivals! To wrap up the year, I attended OMFG! in San Diego, CA, featuring some artists that I have been wanting to see for a long time, such as Porter Robinson.

							Welcome to my website! This is my first post on this website, so it's kind of a test post too, but I'll talk a little bit about what's been going on lately. It's the few days between Christmas and New Years, and I'm staying at my sister's house in LA. I'm treating this as kind of a rest period where I can wind down from the stresses of school. I'm also trying to be productive by reading up on material for my classes next quarter, learning new skills for my internship next quarter, and of course, developing this website!
