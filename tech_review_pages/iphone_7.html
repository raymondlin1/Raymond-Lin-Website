			<h1>iPhone 7 Plus Review</h1>

			<p>February, 2019</p>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>I've been using the iPhone 7 Plus, Matte Black version, as my daily driver for around a year and a half now, and I can say that I do enjoy using this phone. It's a complete package for the average user, packing a great camera, fast processor, decent battery life and display. Prior to using this phone, I was an Android user. There were two main reasons why I switched from Android to iOS. Back when I was an Android user, I loved to mod the smartphone, by rooting it, exploiting hidden functionalities, and flashing custom ROMs onto it. However, coming into college, I realized that I had no more time to mod my smartphone. As a result, I needed something reliable and sturdy. The first reason was that Snapchat was always lagging on my Nexus 6, so I wanted a smartphone that could run Snapchat smoothly. Furthermore, many people found convenience in using products in the Apple ecosystem, mainly iMessage. As a result, I chose the iPhone 7 Plus to be my daily driver, a smartphone that is reliable, runs Snapchat well, and has iMessage.</p>
