						It's time for another post! Right now it's spring break, so I finally have some time to update my website. This quarter has been busy! But I could really say that about any quarter. I thought it wouldn't be that hard since I wasn't taking any project-based CS classes, but the classes I took were definitely more difficult than I had anticipated. This break has been busy too. I caught up with some friends from home, and I also planned to do many productive things, such as work on personal projects, study some technical interview problems, look into research labs and start reading some research papers. I'm planning to solicit some labs at school, because I want to look at the research side of CS - what better time to do so than now, when I'm studying at one of the most prestigious universities in the world? I'm planning to post some summaries of those research papers here on the news section, so stay tuned for those. However, I realized that one week for spring break isn't really enough time to do all that, but I'm doing the best I can. Additionally, this spring break, I jumped back into one of my favorite video games when I was a kid. You've probably guessed the game by now - yes, it's Runescape...
